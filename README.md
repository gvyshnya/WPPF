# WPPF Prototype #

This repo is intended to demonstrate Python programming skills

### What is WPPF ###

WPPF is a solution to predict wind power generation based on weather parameters at the generating meter units.

Key details
* Custom forecasting algorithm based on Fractal Geometry and smart binning
* Custom implementation of kNN search algorithm
* Object-oriented implementation of key solution components in Python 3
* MAPE- and RMSE-based validation in out-of-sample testing 
* Active use of Python Data Science libraries and packages (Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn)

_Note:_ Training data for this solution are confidential, and they will not be provided.
